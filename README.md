This report is an analysis of several thousand Kickstarter (KS) campaigns to determine viability of fulfilling $12,000 KS goal for a US-based musical. Additionally, report shows analysis of viability for KS goal of $4,000 for a musical in Great Britain (GB) as a future project.

The funding goal of $12,000 exceeds the average successful funding goal of $5000 making it less likely to succeed. However, the failure of campaigns cannot be directly attributed to goals significantly higher than average. 

The chart below shows the most successful theatre campaigns launched in May and June.

Recommendation: A $12,000 goal is an ambitiously high, but will not be the limiting factor in a successful campaign. Recommend lowering budget needs to increase chances of success. Client should plan on launching campaign in May or June to further increase chances of success.

On average, Great Britain-based KS campaigns for musicals raise ~$1,000, but half raise little to no funds.  The successful campaigns of Be Prepared, Checkpoint 22, Cutting off Kate Bush, Jestia Raedon, The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Family all reached their goals, however, only one had a goal of more than $2,000.

Recommendation: For a future project in Great Britain a $4,000 goal is unlikely to be reached. A KS goal of below $1,500 would be more likely to succeed on the KS platform and we would advise altering the proposed budget.
